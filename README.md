# ArUco markers generator

A colab notebook to generate ArUco markers in batch.

## Motivation

Generating a large number of Aruco markers can be tedious and time-consuming.

The notebook in this repo streamlines the process, allowing to generate Aruco markers in batch with just a few lines of code.

## How it works

This repo contains a Colab notebook which uses the OpenCV library to generate Aruco markers in batch and it allows you to specify the parameters such as the marker size, dictionary, 
and number of markers to generate.

The generated markers are saved as image files, which you can then download and use in your applications.
